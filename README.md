# Encryption-Algorithim-Using-Trees
A new data encryption and decryption method is proposed using ASCII values of characters in the plaintext and Binary Tree Traversal (BTT). First level encryption uses ASCII values of the plaintext characters to achieve substitution. Then, the binary tree traversal is used as the second level of encryption for achieving permutation. Also, the algorithm does not explicitly use any key to encrypt the data. The algorithm has been verified with experimental results.
