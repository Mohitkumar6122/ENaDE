# Encryption-Algorithm-Using-Trees
A new data encryption and decryption method is developed using ASCII values of characters in the plaintext and Binary Tree Traversal (BTT).<br> First level encryption uses ASCII values of the plaintext characters to achieve substitution. Then, the binary tree traversal is used as the second level of encryption for achieving permutation.<br> Also, the algorithm does not explicitly use any key to encrypt the data. The algorithm has been verified with experimental results.

## The following are the salient features of this algorithm:
1. This algorithm uses two levels of encryption and decryption which makes it robust against attacks.
2. It makes use of the ASCII values of the characters, swapping, addition, subtraction, construction of a
complete binary tree, reversing the alternate levels and level order traversal.
3. It does not use a key explicitly to encrypt and decrypt data.
4. There is no overhead involved in key generation, key distribution/sharing and keeping the key securely.
5. This method is simple and easy to implement.
